# GiphySearch

An exercise in creating a Angular 2 App on a static page that allows for users to scroll through and view projects that I have created. The core feature is a Giphy Search app that allows users to enter a search term into the app and get back 25 giphy responses through the Giphy Search API. The App was built using Angular 4 and also integated Bootstrap 4 into the design elements through an NPM package.

## Demo 

You can view a demo of the application here - https://portfolio-app-giphy.herokuapp.com/

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
